<p>My name is Joachim Haagen Skeie. On a daily basis I work as a senior IT consultant at <a href="http://www.kantega.no/">Kantega</a>. I hold a Masters degree in Information Technology from <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">Queensland University of Technology</a> in Brisbane, Australia. I have worked as a Software Engineer since july 2007 in various positions ranging from developer, Scrum Master and Software Architect. I am a certified ScrumMaster and have primarily worked on large-scale Java applications providing automatic store replenishment for Norways largest retailer. I have received very good feedback from both colleages, leaders and customers, as can be seen from my <a href="http://no.linkedin.com/pub/joachim-haagen-skeie/11/893/78b">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
